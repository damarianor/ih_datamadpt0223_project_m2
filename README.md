## Overview

The purpose of this project is to to apply our knowledge gained from module 2 of this program. In this project, our main task was selecting a dataset, utilizing Tableau or Power BI to explore it, and creating a Story/Dashboard that presents the insights you have extracted from the data. It is important to showcase your proficiency and the concepts learned throughout the chapter.

## Steps followed

I have used a dataset that includes information about shootings in the United States in order to carry out this project. Within this dataset, you can find data such as race, year, mental health issues, location, etc. After selecting and cleaning the data, I have decided to ask myself the following questions as a guide to base my dashboard on:

- Which racial group has conducted the most shootings in the USA?
- Total number of cases and individuals affected
- Number of victims and the year of the shooting
- Did the perpetrators have mental health issues?
- Where were these firearms obtained?
- What types of firearms were used?
- Were these firearms obtained legally?


## **Deliverables:**

A GitHub repository including:

- A `data model` showing the table schemas and relations between them. You may use an application such as [DBdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/).

- A `functional design mockup` where the dashboard parts and functionalities must be represented. This document should be an starting point, meaning that the final product can be different. You may use any tool you want, however, it is highly recommended to use _ink and paper_!!!

- A `BI Report/Dashboard` meeting the requeriments specified in __Challenge 1__. If you use __Tableau__ you need to include the _Tableau Public link_ to the reporting app. If you use __Power BI__ you need to include the `.pbix` file in your repo. 

- A `README.md` file explaining the job done, the reporting app architecture and your main conclusions after the exploratory data analysis. You may find more info of how to build a README file [here](https://github.com/potacho/data-project-template/blob/master/README.md).

## **Presentation:**

- __Time:__ 5 minutes __sharp__.

- __Content:__ eventhough the perfect report/dashboard should be selfexplanatory, you'll need to explain the reporting architecture and show its funtionalities. Also, you'll need to give actionable insights about your data and support your arguments using the report.

> __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ You only need your BI Report/Dashboard for the presentation (i.e.: no Jupyter, no PowerPoint/Canva)

## __Challenge 1: BI Report/Dashboard__

BI Reports and Dashboards are powerful tools for communicating important information __at-a-glance__. The goal of this challenge is to build a BI Report/Dashboard using a dataset of your choice. Bear in mind the __purpose__ of the report and build a __normalized__ model that fits your visualization requeriments and interactivity performance.

You may use either __Tableau__ or __Power BI__ as your main tool for creating your reporting app. There are not restictions about the data source location or format (local drive, database, multiformat, etc.).

> __Tip:__ you should first consider which data and which indicators should be put on the BI Report/Dashboard. Then, decompose the key indicators from multiple dimensions.

A BI Report/Dashboard is not exactly a sequential set of descriptive charts. Instead, a BI Report/Dashboard should be __a single interactive interface built around a specific objetive and which components are logically arranged in order to provide data relevant insights effectively__.
